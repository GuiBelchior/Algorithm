# Algoritmo
Fundamentals for C# - Upskill Module

# C# Algorithm Module Documentation

## Objectives
In this module, our main objectives are:
1. Analyze problems and create programs to solve them.
2. Implement algorithms, both self-created and from other sources.
3. Program using the C# programming language.
